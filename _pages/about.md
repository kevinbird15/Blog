Impartial Derivative is a blog designed to look at technical concepts and ideas with an impartial eye.  My name is Kevin Bird and I have a passion for innovation, machine learning, and automation.  I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Nebraska in Omaha studying Computer Engineering.  I also studied entrepreneurship while I was in school and am excited to discuss new ideas and also technologically challenging ideas.  Helping others solve challenges in implementations and execution of ideas are two things that I enjoy. 

Since graduating from college, I have focused on learning a lot of the concepts that I passed tests on in college, but didn't fully understand.  My goal when I am learning new concepts post-college is to understand the intuition behind the concepts and to be able to explain the concept in my own words.  That is where my blog comes in.  I will document my learning journey and do my best to convey the concepts in simple terms.  I also want to preserve as much of the learning process as well.  My goal when writing blog posts is to include a summary to allow anybody to get the key takeaways even if the article goes a little deeper than an individual cares about.  

I work using an iterative process and I have continued to hone my skills over time using [fast.ai](fast.ai), Kaggle, and other competitions.  These competitions are a great place to learn new techniques and also to see if you are actually getting better at data science.  I have had a few finishes that I am happy about including a 2nd place finish in the [HackerEarth Predict the Happiness Competition](<https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/predict-the-happiness/leaderboard/>), a 2nd place finish in the [Haha 2019 Funniness Prediction Classification challenge](<https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22194#results>), and a 3rd place finish in the [Haha 2019 Funniness Prediction Regression challenge](<https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22194#results>).  I also have three top 20% finishes on Kaggle. ([Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification), [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification), and [Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition))

Productionalizing models by creating APIs in Flask has been one of the areas that I enjoy focusing on.  One of the areas I am most excited to use this functionality is combining automation with predictive models to allow a bot to tackle more complex problems that may not be easy this-or-that decisions.
